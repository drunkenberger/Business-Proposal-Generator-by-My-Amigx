## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Transmission to Third-Party Services

**Anthropic Claude API**: Your project details (client information, service descriptions, deliverables, cost items, and timeline data) are sent to Anthropic's servers to generate AI-enhanced proposal content. Anthropic may log these interactions according to their privacy policy. We recommend reviewing [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) for details on data handling.

### Local Data Handling

**API Keys**: Your Anthropic API key is used only during the active browser session for API requests and is never transmitted to our servers or stored permanently. The key exists only in browser memory and is cleared when you close the application.

**Generated Proposals**: Completed proposals are processed entirely in your browser and are not transmitted to or stored on our servers. Downloaded documents remain exclusively on your device.

### Privacy Recommendations

- **Use Your Own API Key**: For maximum privacy control, use your own Anthropic API key rather than a shared one
- **Review Generated Content**: Check AI-generated proposals for any sensitive information before sharing
- **API Provider Settings**: Consider adjusting your Anthropic account's data retention settings if available
- **Local Processing**: All document formatting, export generation, and final proposal assembly happens locally in your browser
